This application is a desktop app made with PyQt. It accesses your webcam and continuously checks for your emotions in background. Using the dominant emotion from last minute and YouTube API, it searches for a song, downloads it and adds it to queue.

You can also skip the songs if you don't like them and it will play another song for you. The application also has a history, so you don't have to worry about repeating songs.

Technologies used: `Python` `PyQt` `Microsoft Cognitive Services` `OpenCV`
